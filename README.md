# grw

This library implements generalised rewriting based on the Coq approach and the paper "A New Look at Generalized Rewriting in TypeTheory" by Matthieu Sozeau.

## Roadmap

- [x] generate the same constraints coq does
- [ ] compare algorithm and constraints of the coq and the paper version
- [ ] recreate eauto efficiently to handle multiple related goals
- [ ] solve real-world grw problems

  abstract  = {We present Aesop, a proof search tactic for the Lean 4 interactive  
               theorem prover. Aesop performs a tree-based search over a user-specified  
               set of proof rules. It supports safe and unsafe rules and uses a best-first  
               search strategy with customisable prioritisation. Aesop also allows users  
               to register custom normalisation rules and integrates Lean's simplifier to  
               support equational reasoning. Many details of Aesop's search procedure are  
               designed to make it a white-box proof automation tactic, meaning that users  
               should be able to easily predict how their rules will be applied, and thus how  
               powerful and fast their Aesop invocations will be.  
               
               Since we use a best-first search strategy, it is not obvious how to handle  
               metavariables which appear in multiple goals. The most common strategy for  
               dealing with metavariables relies on backtracking and is therefore not  
               suitable for best-first search. We give an algorithm which addresses this  
               issue. The algorithm works with any search strategy, is independent of the  
               underlying logic and makes few assumptions about how rules interact with  
               metavariables. We conjecture that with a fair search strategy, the algorithm  
               is as complete as the given set of rules allows.},

= Generalised Rewriting in Literature <PaperAlgo>

We briefly mentioned that the literature algorithm about generalised rewriting consists of two parts. To understand the proof and constraint generation section of that algorithm, we will start by introducing Lean expressions, explain Coq's morphism framework, and finally provide the algorithm specification.

== Terms in Lean

In this section, we will clarify the terms goal, subgoal, Lean term, and constraint by explaining the nature of Lean expressions.

A term (or expression) in Lean 4 can be represented as any of the following variants: `const`, `sort`, `fvar`, `mvar`, `app`, `lam`, `bvar`, `forallE`, `letE`, `lit`, `mdata`, or `proj`. They esentially corresponds to an extension of the simply typed λ-calculus @lambdacalc. Those variants each represent a unique constructor of Lean's expression (`Expr`) type:

```lean
inductive Expr : Type where
  | app : Expr → Expr → Expr
  | bvar : Nat → Expr
  | const : Name → List Level → Expr
  | forallE : Name → Expr → Expr → BinderInfo → Expr
  | fvar : FVarId → Expr
  | lam : Name → Expr → Expr → BinderInfo → Expr
  | letE : Name → Expr → Expr → Expr → Bool → Expr
  | lit : Literal → Expr
  | mdata : MData → Expr → Expr
  | mvar : MVarId → Expr
  | proj : Name → Nat → Expr → Expr
  | sort : Level → Expr
```

Note that some constructors of the `Expr` type contain references to `Expr` itself. This means that expressions can be built from other expressions. Throughout this thesis, we refer to those nested expressions as sub-expressions or subterms. For instance, the `app` constructor requires two sub-expressions for the left-hand side and the right-hand side. The term ```lean Expr.app (Expr.const a []) (Expr.const b [])``` results in an application expression containing two sub-expressions for the constants `a` and `b`.

- Expr.app represents function applications, e.g.: $f(a, b)$ in Lean that we denote $f space a space b$.
- Expr.bvar is a variable bound by a lambda expression or universal quantifier.
- Expr.const refers to constants such as definitions or theorems that have a unique name.
- Expr.forallE represents dependent and non-dependent function types.
- Expr.fvar is Lean's representation for free variables in the local context.
- Expr.lam is the expression-type for anonymous function or lambda expressions in Lean.
- Expr.letE are let bindings inside do-blocks in Lean.
- Expr.lit is any natural number or string literal in Lean.
- Expr.mdata is the expression for annotations.
- Expr.mvar is a metavariable, a syntactic hole in a Lean expression.
- Expr.proj is a more efficient notation for product types in Lean.
- Expr.sort is the level of types where `sort 0` represents propositions and $mono("sort" n)$ is of type $mono("sort" n + 1)$.

Expressions of type `mvar` are the kind of Lean expressions that also represent the goals and subgoals that we want to prove. In Lean's tactic mode, we always have one active main goal that we need to solve first. Metavariables are called existential variables in Coq and are a crucial part of the algorithm for generalised rewriting. The constraints we mentioned earlier are synonymous for metavariables. However, during the rewriting process, we usually inspect them prior to becoming goals for the user to solve @metaprogrammingbook.

Metavariables of a certain type $Gamma tack tau$ can be assigned with any value $Gamma tack e : tau$ in the context $Gamma$ (hypotheses, theorems, etc.). Both $Gamma$ and $tau$ are part of that metavariable. When we assign a metavariable that represents a goal, we also close the goal. Another way to leverage metavariables is to use them as placeholders in any given Lean term when the value is unknown at the time of creation. It is also possible to share a metavariable $?_x$ across multiple terms. Assigning such a metavariable with a value $v$ also assigns every occurrence of $?_x$ with $v$. Whenever we choose variable names starting with a question mark in this thesis, we refer to metavariables @metaprogrammingbook.

Another concept frequently used in the rewriting algorithm we propose is unification. In Lean 4, unification refers to the assignments of metavariables so that two terms $t$ and $u$ containing them become definitionally equal @ullrich @carneiro2019type. We will refer to two different functions for unification. Given a term $rho : r space a space a'$ with $r : alpha -> alpha -> mono("Prop")$ and $a space a' : alpha$, the function $mono("unify")_rho (t)$ tries to unify t with the left-hand side of $rho$'s applied relation. The function also introduces local hypotheses for bound variables of possible `forallE` or `lam` expressions in $t$, in which case unification is evaluated on the according body. The $mono("unify")$ function returns tuple $(Psi, r, u, b)$. The first element is a set $Psi$ of hypotheses corresponding to the newly introduced binder variables that were not reassigned during unification. The relation $r$ represents the relation over the successful unification and is typically the relation used in $rho$. The term $u$ is the term that was made equal through unification, typically the right-hand side of $rho$. The last argument $b$ is a boolean value that is `true` when unification succeeded and is `false` otherwise. The modified version $mono("unify"^"*")_rho (t)$ has the same behaviour but tries unification on all subterms and succeeds if at least one unification does @sozeau:inria-00628904.

== Proof Strategies for Rewriting

We mentioned that every rewrite must be justified by a proof and the rewrite tactic must provide that proof. When we want to prove a goal $P space t : mono("Prop")$ where the function $P : alpha -> mono("Prop")$ is applied to the argument $t : alpha$ and we have a hypothesis $h$ of type $r space t space u$ given $r$ is a relation $alpha arrow alpha arrow mono("Prop")$, we can prove a rewrite from $t$ to $u$ given we have the additional information that $P$ is preserved by $r$. In order to generate a rewrite proof for that, $r$ must be an equivalence relation or imply the implication relation ($<-$). Essentially, this means ($<-$) is a direct subrelation of $r$ or a transitive subrelation. When those hypotheses are in place, the proof is straight forward for this minimal example. By Lean's definition of subrelations, it suffices to show $r space (P space t) space ?_t$ and $?_t$. We can assign $?_t$ with $P space u$ can eventually proceed to obtaining a proof for the rewrite $P space t <- P space u$.

#definition("Subrelation")[
  ```lean
  class Subrelation (q r : α → α → Prop) :=
    subrelation : ∀ {x y}, q x y → r x y
  ```
]<subrel>

Performing a rewrite always boils down to finding a proof that justifies the rewrite and applying that proof. Even the `rewrite` tactic already supported by Lean for rewriting with equalities merely generates proofs for a rewrite and applies it. The rewrite proof we have just observed leverages right-to-left implication to justify a valid rewrite. Similarly, a proof term of a left-to-right implication can directly be applied to a hypothesis. Equality is also a way to justify rewrites by leveraging the `rewrite` tactic already in place for Lean. However, for the remaining thesis, we choose implications as our choice for justifying rewrites. For simplicity, we will only consider rewrites on goals (right-to-left implications) and briefly mention the required change for rewriting hypotheses in @Implementation.

== Coq's Morphism Framework

Before we have a look at the rewriting algorithm, we want to define how Coq and also our Lean implementation use morphisms to achieve successful rewrites. The following section specifies what we mean when we say that a function is preserved by a relation.

The morphism framework introduced by Mattheiu Sozeau @sozeau:inria-00628904 consists of `respectful` and `Proper` definitions that can construct proofs for arbitrary terms using a syntax-directed algorithm. The `Proper` definition in @ProperDef takes a reflexive relation $r$ and an element $m$ in that relation. Whenever this definition holds, we call $m$ a `Proper` element of $r$ meaning that $m$ is a morphism for $r$. The `respectful` definition seen in @respectfulDef denoted as ($==>$) is Coq's notion for signatures. This definition can produce very general implications for a variety of functions. For instance, the contrapositive theorem $forall x space y : mono("Prop"), (x -> y) -> (not y -> not y)$ can be stated as $((->) ==> (<-)) space (not) space (not)$. We can even simplify the contrapositive theorem by leveraging `Proper` and `respectful` with $"Proper" ((->) ==> (<-)) space (not)$. We can see this by unfolding the definitions:

#align(center)[
  #box()[
    $
      & mono("Proper") ((->) ==> (<-)) space (not) &\
      & ((->) ==> (<-)) space (not) space (not) & ["Proper constructor"] \
      & (mono("respectful") (->) space (<-)) space (not) space (not) & ["unfold notation \"" ==> "\"]" \
      & (lambda space f space g mapsto forall x space y, (x -> y) -> (f space x <- g space y)) space (not) space (not) & ["unfold respectful"]\
      & ∀ x space y : mono("Prop"), (x -> y) → (¬x <- ¬y) & [beta-"reduction"] \
    $
  ]
]

We can use the same infrastructure to specify the above rewrite from $P space t$ to $P space u$ in a more general way. We assume that we have the same hypothesis $h : r space t space u$. When $r$ preserves $P$, we can create (and prove) a hypothesis $h_p$ of type $mono("Proper") (r ==> (<-)) space P$. We can transform the type of $h_p$ to $forall x space y, (r space x space y) -> (P x <- P y)$ by following the same steps as for the contrapositive calculation. When a hypothesis contains a universal quantifier over $x$ and $y$, we can instantiate the two variables. If we do so with $t$ and $u$ we obtain a modified hypothesis $r space t space u -> (P space t <- P space u)$. When we apply $h$ to this hypothesis, we obtain a proof of a rewrite from $P space t$ to $P space u$.

#definition("Proper")[
  ```lean
  class Proper (r : relation α) (m : α) where
    proper : r m m
  ```
] <ProperDef>

#definition("respectful")[
  ```lean
  def respectful (r : relation α) (r' : relation β) : relation (α → β) :=
    λ f g ↦ ∀ x y, r x y → r' (f x) (g y)
  ```
] <respectfulDef>

To convince you that the same procedure can also be used to generate rewrites for other terms, we want to explore a second example where the term we want to rewrite occurs inside a conjunction. Let $p$ and $q$ be of type $mono("Prop")$ and $h$ be a hypothesis of type $p = q$. We also assume that we have a hypothesis $h_p$ that states that Conjunctions are preserved by the equality relation. Thus, $h_p$ is of type $"Proper" ((=) ==> (<->) ==> (<-)) space (and)$. It translates to $forall x space y, x = y -> forall x' y', x' <-> y' -> (x and x' <- y and y')$. When instantiating the variables in $h_p$, for instance with $p, q, (h : p = q), q, q, (h' : b <-> b)$, we would obtain a proof for $(p and q <- q and q)$.

In the second example, we can see a nested occurrence of `respectful`. When unfolding the definitions, we interpret it left-to-right as seen above and implicitly read parenthesis like so: $((=) ==> ((<->) ==> (<-)))$. We will refer to such nested respectful arrows as a respectful chain and to the arguments as elements of that chain in the remaining chapters. The reason we use two respectful arrows here is to match the desired type of the second `Proper` argument $(and)$. Conjunctions in Lean have the type $mono("Prop") -> mono("Prop") -> mono("Prop")$. Each relation in a respectful chain must be $mono("relation") alpha$ where $alpha$ is the corresponding type in the function that embodies the second `Proper` argument. For instance, the function $f : alpha_0 -> alpha_1$ requires a respectful chain $(a_0 : mono("relation") alpha_0) ==> (a_1 : mono("relation") alpha_1)$ for the term $mono("Proper") space (a_0 ==> a_1) space f$ to be well-formed. All three elements of the respectful chain above are relations over propositions. This matches the conjunction's type $and : mono("Prop") -> mono("Prop") -> mono("Prop")$. This always has to match in order to create a well-formed rewrite proof using this `Proper` framework.

Note that for this case, it does not matter whether we have the relation ($<->$), ($->$), or ($=$) as the middle element for the respectful chain. In fact, any reflexive relation over `Prop` would work here. Proceeding with this framework, we have to be mindful of which rewrites we can simplify with `Proper` and `respectful` proofs. We also need to consider which relations we use inside such a chain, how to choose the first and final relation argument, and finally what element we want to be proper under the sequence of `respectful` relations.

The Coq library for morphisms has many theorems that operate on `Proper` and `respectful` terms which help to construct and solve theorems containing morphisms and signatures during the proof search. This allows us to use the same structure and theorems for rewrites in different terms. The proof construction for the rewrite proofs $p and q <- q and q$ and $p or q <- q or q$ can both be realised using `Proper` and `respectful`. This generalisation is the basis for the algorithm proposed by Matthieu Sozeau @sozeau:inria-00628904 that automatically produces rewrite proofs for any given proper relation where the term to be rewritten can be behind binders and nested in other structures. There is one more definition that makes the proposed algorithm more powerful. When we have a term $mono("Proper") (A ==> B) space f$ and we know that $B$ is a subrelation of $C$, we can imply that $mono("Proper") (A ==> C) space f$ also holds. Thus, we can leverage subrelations as defined in @subrel.

== Algorithm Specification

The core idea of the approach for rewriting proposed in @sozeau:inria-00628904 is to break down generalised rewriting into two parts. The first part that we introduced as the constraint generation algorithm is a procedure that generates a proof skeleton (a proof term containing metavariables) for the rewrite leveraging `Proper`, `respectful`, and `Subrelation` as seen above. In previous examples, we have seen that while we know what type such a proof must have, we don't always know the actual instances of the `Proper` or `Subrelation` classes. They each only have a single constructor. We know that a proof for a `Subrelation` term must be constructed with `Subrelation.subrelation`. This means a proof that for a given relation $q$ and a given relation $r$, all $x$ and $y$ must satisfy $q space x space y -> r space x space y$ and similarly for `Proper` proofs. We may, however, not always know the proof for $forall x space y, q space x space y -> r space x space y$. This is why the algorithm uses metavariables for those instances and for some sub-expressions. For instance, a proof skeleton for a simple atomic term $p : mono("Prop")$, meaning $p$ contains no subterms, and a proof $h : r space p space q$ a proof for a rewrite would be of type $mono("Subrelation.subrelation (Prop)") space r space (<-) space ?_m space p space q space h$. Notice that $?_m$ is a metavariable of type $mono("Subrelation" space r space (<-))$ which unfolds to $forall x space y, r space x space y -> (x <- y)$. The application $?_m space p space q space h$ gives us the desired rewrite. The assignment for the metavariable $?_m$ is unknown and left as a hole in this proof. With more nested terms, this algorithm collects multiple unassigned metavariables.

This is where the second part of the proposed approach, a proof search, comes into play. In Coq, this proof search is realized using typeclass resolution #cite(<sozeau:inria-00628904>) #cite(<casteran:hal-00702455>). Typeclass resolution in Coq searches through user-defined instances of a typeclass and applies those instances. For example, the typeclass instance `iff_impl_subrelation` is an instance for the `Subrelation` typeclass in Coq that provides a proof for $mono("Subrelation" (<->) space (<-))$ which can be leveraged whenever the rewrite relation is $(<->)$.

The algorithm in @rewalgo is an imperative translation of the declarative algorithm proposed in @sozeau:inria-00628904 that follows our implementation in Lean 4. The algorithm is syntax directed and covers every term that can be constructed in Lean. The algorithm divides Lean terms between function applications, lambda functions, dependent arrow types, non-dependent arrow types, and a default case for all remaining expression variants.

The algorithm takes a term $t$ in which we want to rewrite and a hypothesis $rho$ that is of the type $r space a space b$ where $r$ is a relation, $a$ is a subterm we want to rewrite in $t$, and $b$ is the value we want to replace $a$ with. The algorithm outputs a tuple ($Psi$, $r$, $u$, $p$). $Psi$ is the set of syntactic holes that appear in the proof $p$. Those holes in the proof are represented as metavariables in Lean. The idea of collecting those constraints separately in a set is to solve them prior to applying the resulting rewrite proof. If we instead applied a proof containing unassigned metavariables, Lean would set them as goals for the user to solve. To avoid this, we remember what needs to be solved before applying the proof. The second element of the output tuple, $r$, is the carrier relation for the rewrite proof. The new term $u$ is similar to $t$ with the difference that every occurrence of the left-hand side of $rho$ was replaced with its right-hand side. The final element of the output tuple, $p$, is the proof for the rewrite containing the metavariables in $Psi$. At the beginning, we always check whether the term we want to rewrite unifies directly for the given theorem $rho$. In that case, the proof-result for a rewrite would just be $rho$. Because $rho$ (and any proof-result of this algorithm) is not of the type $t <- u$, we will wrap the output of the algorithm in a proof for $"Subrelation" r space (<-)$. @infersub represents a small algorithm responsible for that subrelation wrapping. When rewriting with `Rew`, we can simply invoke $mono("InferRel") (mono("Rew")_rho (t), t)$. We will cover `InferRel` more in depth in @idsuccstatus.

When we want to rewrite a term $t$ with the left-hand side of a rewrite theorem $rho : r space a space a'$, we need to check for unification of $a$ with a subterm of $t$. However, sometimes we may want to rewrite right-to-left. To achieve this, we instead check if $a'$ unifies with a subterm of $t$. In Lean's `rewrite` tactic, the direction can be stated with an arrow $mono("rewrite [") <- rho space mono("]")$ for right-to-left and per default $mono("rewrite [") rho space mono("]")$ for left-to-right rewrites. Throughout this thesis, we will always assume that a rewrite is left-to-right as it is very simple to change the direction. The only change required for the algorithm to work right-to-left is to update the `unify` function mentioned earlier. 

Whenever a term $t$ does not unify directly, we examine its structure and use a different approach depending on whether $t$ is a function application, lambda expression, dependent/non-dependent arrow, or constant. Whenever we encounter an application $f space e$, we perform a recursive call on both $f$ and $e$. We use the obtained carrier relation $r_f$, proof, and term to construct a proof that $r_f$ is a subrelation of $r_e ==> ?_T$. This is where the first metavariables occur that we collect in the constraint set $Psi$. This generates a proof for $r space t space u$. Recall that we construct a $"Subrelation" r space (<-)$ after invoking `Rew` which leads to a proof of $t <- u$.

#definition("pointwise relation")[
  ```lean
  def pointwiseRelation (α : Sort u) {β : Sort v} (r : relation β) :
    relation (α → β) := λ f g ↦ ∀ x, r (f x) (g x)
  ```
] <pointwise>

For rewrites inside lambda terms, introduce a local hypothesis, $x : tau$, corresponding to the variable bound by the lambda expression and perform a recursive rewrite on the body of the lambda expression. We denote the introduction of the local hypotheses with the $mono("hyp")$ function. The resulting proof wrapped in a fresh lambda expression while binding $x : tau$ represents the proof for $r space (lambda x:tau. b) space (lambda x:tau. b')$  which eventually progresses to $(lambda x:tau. b) <- (lambda x:tau. b')$. The carrier relation for rewrites inside lambda functions is a pointwise relation (see @pointwise). This allows pointwise extending the original proof @sozeau:inria-00628904.

#definition("impl")[
  ```lean
  def impl (α β : Prop) : Prop := α → β
  ```
] <impl>

#definition("all")[
  ```lean
  def all (α : Sort u) (p : α -> Prop) :=
    ∀x, p x
  ```
] <all>

The remaining cases leverage either the lambda or application case by converting the term $t$ slightly to fit in the scheme. Terms of non-dependent function types are transformed into the constant `impl` as defined in @impl. This has the advantage that `const` definitions applied to arguments are represented as applications in Lean and thus reuse the already defined application case. We apply the same strategy for the case of a dependent function type that uses a local dependent function `all` as defined in @all.

Finally, we will have a look at the last case that is triggered whenever none of the above cases match. This is the case for constants such as `all`, `impl`, or simply for atoms (terms containing no futher subterms) that do not unify at the beginning of the `Rew` function. In this case, we construct another metavariable of type $"Proper" tau space ?_r t'$ that is treated as a hole at the bottom of the proof tree. We denote the creation of new metavariables using the $mono("mvar")$ function that takes a type and returns a metavariable of that type. It essentially represents a syntactic hole for a proof of an identity rewrite from $t$ to $t$ over a relation that is also a metavariable. This will always happen for this algorithm as we never specify the desired relation for the proof and generate metavariables whenever we do not know the relation.

#example("Conjunction rewrite")[

To demonstrate an example where we can see multiple different subterms but still keep an overview over the generated constraints, we choose a rather untypical rewrite. We want to rewrite a proposition in a conjunction using bi-implication. The algorithm rewrites $p and q$ to $q and q$ for a given relation $r$ that is a subrelation of $(<-)$ and a given proof $h : r space p space q$. The algorithm first tries to unify the entire term $p and q$ with the left-hand side of our proof ($p$). Conjunctions in Lean are defined by the `And` structure. Thus, our term $t$ is interpreted as $mono("And") p space q$ which must be read as $(mono("And") space p) space q$. This falls into the `app` case such that we first interpret $(mono("And") p)$ followed by $q$. Again the term $(mono("And") p)$ doesn't unify with $p$, and the algorithm follows another `app` iteration for the terms `And` and $p$. `And` itself does not unify and does not match any other category. Therefore, the algorithm treats it as an atom (`const`) and generates a metavariable $?_(mono("And")_r) : mono("relation") (mono("relation Prop"))$ and passes ($?_(mono("And")_m) : mono("Proper") (mono("relation") mono("Prop")) space ?_(mono("And")_r) mono("And")$) for the proof of identity. The next term we consider, $p$, does indeed unify with $p$ and is therefore replaced with $q$. For now, the return value for the proof will be just $h$. After the two recursive `Rew`-invocations terminate, we combine the proofs and carrier relations for a proof of $r space (mono("And") space p) space (mono("And") space q)$. We start with another hole $?_(mono("And")_p) : "Subrelation" ?_(mono("And")_r) (r ==> (?_T : "relation (Prop" -> "Prop)"))$. Recall that `Subrelation` is a typeclass with only constructor `subrelation`. Thus, any metavariable of type `Subrelation` must be of that constructor and eventually unfolds to $forall r_1 space r_2, ?_"rel" space r_1 space r_2 -> forall x space y, r space x space y -> ?_T space x space y -> ?_T (r_1 space x) space (r_2 space y)$. This allows us to construct the desired proof by carefully applying the arguments $?_(mono("And")_p) mono("And") mono("And") space ?_(mono("And")_m) space p space q space h$. By instantiating $r_1$ and $r_2$ with the `And` relation and $x$ and $y$ with $p$ and $q$, we receive our desired rewrite proof for this part of the term $?_(mono("And")_T) $.

We will see more metavariables of type `Subrelation` or `Proper` applied to its arguments throughout this thesis where we don't unfold the definition in order to preserve readability of the terms.

The next rewrite to be evaluated is the identity rewrite for $q$. We follow the same procedure as for the `And` rewrite generating $?_(q_r) : mono("relation Prop")$ and the proof ($?_(q_m) : mono("Proper Prop") space ?_(q_r) space q$). The final merge step will combine both proofs in another subrelation $(?_(mono("And")_(p q)) : mono("Subrelation") space ?_T (?_(q_r) ==> (?_T' : mono("relation Prop"))))$. The algorithm then outputs $?_(mono("And")_(p q)) space (mono("And") p) space (mono("And") q) space (?_(mono("And")_p) mono("And") mono("And") space ?_(mono("And")_m) space p space q space h) space q space q space ?_(q_m)$ which is a proof for $?_T' space (p and q) space (q and q)$.

There are two issues with this proof. The first issue is that the rewrite proof output of $"Rew"_h (p and q)$ is not an implication ($<-$) but an unknown relation $?_T'$. This can easily be fixed by creating another metavariable $?_"final"$ as a placeholder for a proof that $?_T'$ is a subrelation for ($<-$). This is the purpose of the algorithm in @infersub. That brings us to the second problem that the proof contains many metavariables that need to be assigned. The paper @sozeau:inria-00628904 suggests a proof search that operates depth-first proof search on the constraints (set of metavariables).

For the example of $p and q$, we collect the metavariables as we create them and end up with the final constraint set ${?_(mono("And")_r), ?_(mono("And")_m), ?_(mono("And")_p), ?_T, ?_(q_r), ?_(q_m), ?_(mono("And")_(p q)), ?_T', ?_"final"}$. In our Lean 4 implementation, we initially solved those goals using the automated extensible search tactic `aesop` @aesop with a custom rule set containing the theorems and tactics mentioned in the Coq Morphism library @coqmorphism.

Eventually, we had to develop our own proof search that is tailored to the constraints generated by the algorithm. Aesop can only backtrack a single goal and all their resulting subgoals. However, for the constraints generated by the `Rew` algorithm, we have to backtrack across multiple goals and their assignments. The reason for this is that the elements in the generated constraint set may share metavariables that can be solved easily when isolated but require more specific solutions when considering other constraints. The conjunction proof $?_p : mono("Proper") ((=) ==> ?_r ==> (<-)) space (and)$ mentioned in @Introduction, for instance, contains two metavariables. The metavariable $?_p$ must be assigned using the `proper` constructor, and $?_r : mono("relation Prop")$ must be assigned with a relation over `Prop`. Many assignments would be feasible for $?_r$, including the relations $->$, $and$, or $eq$. However, in a proof search that operates per goal it would be feasible to first solve $?_r$ with the implication relation. This would affect the metavariable $?_p$ to change to $mono("Proper") ((=) ==> (->) ==> (<-))$ which is not solvable without having instantiated the parameters of $?_p$. Thus, in such a case, we have to backtrack from the goal $?_p$ to a different assignment of $?_r$ and try another path. In such a case, our proof search using the `aesop` tactic would never find a solution because the goals that were already assigned cannot be undone if it causes another goal in the constraint set to fail.

== Challenges in Practice

The algorithm proposed thus far can rewrite behind binders and within arbitrary terms in our Lean 4 implementation. However, when trying to solve larger instances, we run into serious performance issues. There are two main reasons for this.

The first challenge when applying this approach in practice is that even for terms where no rewrite occurs, the amount of generated constraints is quadratic in the depth of a term tree. The proof search itself is exponential for the amount of constraints. This gives us a strong motivation to reduce the amount of constraints where possible.

The other reason those constraints are difficult to solve is that nested subrelation instances are more difficult to find than just `Proper` and `respectful` instances. This is because most arguments in the middle of a respectful chain inside a `Proper` instance must be merely reflexive, and the resulting proper instance can then be shown using deconstruction of the constructor and reflexivity.

Let us consider another example where the constraints become more difficult to solve. To visualize the generated proof better, we will skip the individual steps and show a graph that represents the rewrite sequence where each edge represents the return value passed by a recursive invocation of the `Rew` algorithm.

Each node is split into two rows where the first row shows the term $t$ to be rewritten in the first column, the carrier relation $r$ over the proof of $r space t space u$ in the second column, and finally the resulting term $u$ in the final column. The second row is a cumulative collection of the generated metavariables that must be solved in order to complete the proof. To keep an overview over the generated metavariables, we refer to metavariables of type `relation` $tau$ as $?r_i$ with $i in NN$ being the index of the variable. Similarly, metavariables of type `Proper` are represented as $?p_i$. Finally, variables that follow the naming $?s_i$ refer to the metavariables of type `Subrelation`.

In order to further improve readability, we use the same notation as seen in @examplesection where we assume that the application of a metavariable of type `Proper` or `Subrelation` is constructed by their unique constructors. This means its application arguments are passed directly to the `Proper.proper` or `Subrelation.subrelation` function type so that $?s_0 space r space q space x space y space h$ unfolds to `Subrelation.subrelation` $r space q space x space y : q space x space y -> r space x space y$. We use $eq^Delta$ as a placeholder to avoid long repeating terms. Whenever we pass more than three arguments as seen in $s 1$ to a metavariable, we implicitly unfold `respectful` definitions and assign values for $x, y$, and $r space x space y$. Therefore, we read $s 1 =^Delta space ?s 1 space (->) space (->) space ?p_1 space p space q space h$ as passing the implications and $?p_1$ to the unfolded `Subrelation.subrelation` definition, and $p, q$, and $h$ to the resulting unfolded `respectful` definition. We refer to the resulting proof as $s 1$.

The example shown in @calltreelongexample considers the rewrite of $(p -> q) and (p -> q)$ given a proof $h$ which is equality in this case. We can see that we start generating constraints for the leaves of the proof tree where we use $h$ as a proof whenever a subterm unifies with $p$ or generate metavariables for terms that fall into the `const` category. We can also observe that the amount of constraints roughly doubles in size as we move through the tree vertically. Using a depth-first proof search approach, we have an exponential growth with the number of metavariables created as part of the proof skeleton. We can see that the multiple occurrences of $->$, $and$, and $q$ result in two metavariables each. By the time we reach the final rewrite proof for the complete term in the root node, the constraint set contains 23 metavariables. Six of them are constraints for subrelation terms, five are `Proper` metavariables, and finally eleven relations must essentially be guessed if not inferred by other theorems during the proof search. Because this growth-factor is not feasible for larger terms, we will consider a few optimisations to the constraint generation approach in the following section.
